    <h4> For the Hacklcub Arcade Game Jam. The theme was <b> loopholes</b></h4>
    <h4> Idea Behind this web game (Can you Work with Giz?): </h4>
      
      
    <p>  The Idea was that there was kinda of a loophole ???? (problem), with code, to where the player could change the rules of the game. I wanted to challenge myself to try and make a web game, mainly using skills I have learned while making projects during hackclub's arcade summer event. <br> During the Arcade event , I have made a Rock paper scissors tournamnent website, a random generators website, and a couple of quizes. I leaned on those skills to make this webgame (Skill: Buttons and Functions). While also learning something new.  <br> I learned that there is an attribute in html called "contenteditable"(contenteditable = true), which allows the user to change the display of a page. <br> I had alot of fun working on this project. This project has inspired me to learn more about game Development, for future Game Jams <br> Started working on this : August 9th, 2024 around 4:07 pm. <br> Ended working on this: August 11th, 2024 Around 10:17 am.</p>
